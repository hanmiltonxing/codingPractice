# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
# Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only 
# store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’231,  231 âˆ’ 1]. 
# For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function
# returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
# From Leetcode
